# Isabella â€” AI Bookkeeping Agent

Isabella is an AI bookkeeping agent that streamlines expense management. It uses **IBM Granite** to extract structured data from receipts, stores it in Google Sheets, and allows you to ask natural-language questions about your spending through Slack. The system is designed for extensibility, with an architecture that supports both direct AI model integration and orchestration via **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**.

### High-Value Use Cases
Isabella's automated data entry and analysis capabilities are valuable across various industries:
- **Consulting & Professional Services**: Effortlessly track project-related expenses, client dinners, and travel costs, simplifying client billing and reimbursement.
- **Retail & Small Business**: Automate the logging of supplier invoices, utility bills, and daily sales receipts, providing a real-time overview of operational costs.
- **Startups & Tech**: Manage subscriptions for SaaS tools, cloud infrastructure bills, and hardware purchases with minimal administrative overhead.
- **Freelancers & Solopreneurs**: Simplify tax preparation by automatically categorizing business lunches, travel, and equipment costs throughout the year.

## How It Works: A Step-by-Step Guide
1.  **Receipt Upload**: A user uploads a receipt (image or PDF) to a designated Slack channel.
2.  **Intelligent OCR**: A vision model extracts the raw text from the receipt.
3.  **AI-Powered Structuring**: The text is sent to the **IBM Granite** model, which intelligently extracts key details like vendor, date, amount, and category, returning a structured JSON object.
4.  **Data Storage**: The structured data is securely appended as a new row in a Google Sheet, creating a permanent, auditable record.
5.  **Natural Language Query**: Users can ask questions in the same Slack channel, like `How much did I spend on travel last month?`.
6.  **AI-Powered Analysis**: **IBM Granite** analyzes the question and converts it into a precise "query plan."
7.  **Execution & Response**: The system uses the plan to filter and aggregate data from the Google Sheet and delivers a clear, formatted answer back to the user in Slack.
