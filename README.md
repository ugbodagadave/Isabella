# Isabella â€” AI Bookkeeping Agent

Isabella is an AI bookkeeping agent that ingests receipts from Slack, extracts structured data using IBM Granite, appends it to Google Sheets, and allows you to ask natural-language questions about your expenses.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- A Slack App with Socket Mode enabled
- Google Service Account credentials

1.  **Clone the repository**
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Create a `.env` file** in the project root and populate it with your credentials for Slack, Google Sheets, and IBM Watsonx. See `how-it-works.md` for a full list of required variables.

    - `Top 3 categories this month`
    - `Show a table of all travel expenses from last quarter`
