# Active Context

## Current Focus: M5 Deployment Complete âœ…
**Status**: Local IBM watsonx Orchestrate Developer Edition successfully deployed and operational with Socket Mode Slack integration. End-to-end production flow validated and working.

## Deployment Phase Completion Summary

### âœ… Successfully Completed Components

**IBM watsonx Orchestrate Developer Edition Setup**
- Local Docker-based Orchestrate server started and operational
- Developer Edition environment activated (`orchestrate env activate local`)
- Agent imported with `spec_version: v1` and Granite model: `ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct`
- Agent definition (`agent.yaml`) properly configured for local deployment

**Slack Socket Mode Integration**
- Socket Mode listener implemented at `tools/slack_socket_runner.py`
- `tools/slack_interface.py` enhanced to download Slack files using WebClient
- File download process: `files_info` â†’ `url_private_download` with Bearer token â†’ temp file â†’ controller
- Handlers always send a valid `text` string to Slack; in test mode, status is mapped to human-readable text
- Socket Mode eliminates need for ngrok/public HTTP endpoints

**End-to-End Flow Validation**
- Complete receipt processing pipeline tested and operational
- Flow: Slack file upload â†’ OCR â†’ Granite JSON â†’ schema validation â†’ Google Sheets append â†’ Slack confirmation
- E2E test passed with provided receipt URL
- Production-like validation confirmed with real Slack upload and Google Sheets append

**Documentation and Configuration**
- All documentation updated to reflect local deployment approach
- `docs/watsonx-integration.md` created with detailed technical integration explanation
- `docs/deployment_plan.md` updated for local Developer Edition deployment
- Memory bank files updated with current operational status
- README.md completely rewritten with comprehensive setup and architecture details

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

**Agent Configuration (`agent.yaml`)**
- `spec_version: v1` (string format for Developer Edition compatibility)
- Root-level configuration: `name`, `description`, `model`, `instructions`
- Skills mapped 1:1 to repository tools
- Slack channel configured with environment variable substitution
- Model hard-set to `ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct` for clarity

**Socket Mode Architecture**
- `tools/slack_socket_runner.py`: Dedicated Socket Mode listener
- Environment variables loaded via `python-dotenv` in runner
- `SocketModeHandler` receives events without public HTTP
- File downloads handled via Slack WebClient with bot token authentication
- Temporary file management with automatic cleanup

**Error Handling and Testing**
- Unit tests updated to handle Socket Mode scenarios
- `_test_mode` flag added to `slack_interface.py` for test isolation
- E2E tests configured to work with provided receipt URLs
- Environment variable loading fixed for test sessions

### ðŸ“Š Operational Metrics

**Validation Results**
- âœ… E2E test passed with provided PDF receipt
- âœ… Slack confirmation message: "âœ… Your receipt has been added to Google Sheets"
- âœ… Google Sheets append successful with header-driven mapping
- âœ… OCR text extraction working (Tesseract)
- âœ… Granite 3.3 JSON extraction and schema validation operational
- âœ… Socket Mode event handling confirmed

**Performance Indicators**
- Socket Mode listener stable and responsive
- File download and processing pipeline operational
- No secrets exposed in logs or code
- Environment variable configuration working correctly

### ðŸ”„ Current Operational Status

**Active Components**
- IBM watsonx Orchestrate Developer Edition running locally
- Socket Mode listener operational (`tools/slack_socket_runner.py`)
- Agent imported and available in local Orchestrate UI
- All environment variables properly configured

**Monitoring and Logs**
- Orchestrate server logs: `orchestrate server logs`
- Socket Mode listener logs: visible in terminal running the listener
- Structured logging implemented across all components
- Correlation IDs for end-to-end request tracking

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase Opportunities

**Immediate Enhancements**
- Interactive manual review buttons (Approve/Reject) for low-confidence receipts
- Enhanced structured logging with duration metrics across all steps
- Performance monitoring and alerting capabilities
- HTTP mode documentation for ngrok-based deployment

**Production Hardening**
- Correlation ID propagation across all components
- Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Audit trail enhancement with Slack confirmation timestamps
- Manual review workflow implementation

### ðŸ“‹ Operational Notes

**Deployment Approach**
- Primary: Socket Mode (no public HTTP required)
- Alternative: HTTP mode via ngrok (documented but not implemented)
- Local Developer Edition eliminates cloud Orchestrate dependencies

**Security Considerations**
- All secrets managed via environment variables
- No credentials in code or logs
- Slack file downloads use token-authenticated URLs
- Temporary files cleaned up after processing

**Troubleshooting Resources**
- `docs/deployment_plan.md`: Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- `docs/watsonx-integration.md`: Technical integration details
- Memory bank files: Current state and decision history
- Test suite: Validation and regression testing

## Recent Changes
- âœ… Local Orchestrate Developer Edition started via Docker
- âœ… Agent imported with `spec_version: v1` and Granite model set: `ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct`
- âœ… Slack Socket Mode listener implemented at `tools/slack_socket_runner.py`
- âœ… `tools/slack_interface.py` downloads Slack files and forwards `local_path` to controller
- âœ… End-to-end receipt flow validated from Slack upload â†’ OCR â†’ Granite JSON â†’ schema validation â†’ Google Sheets append â†’ Slack confirmation
- âœ… All documentation updated with deployment completion details
- âœ… E2E tests passing with provided receipt URL
- âœ… Code committed and pushed to GitHub repository

## Operational Notes
- Socket Mode used (no ngrok required). If HTTP mode is preferred, use ngrok and configure `/slack/events` and `/slack/actions` URLs.
- Logs: use `orchestrate server logs` for platform services and run the socket listener to observe Slack events.
- Production flow operational: upload receipt to Slack â†’ automatic processing â†’ Google Sheets append â†’ Slack confirmation
- All components tested and validated end-to-end

## Next Steps
- Add interactive manual review (Approve/Reject) buttons for low confidence/duplicates
- Expand observability: correlation IDs and duration metrics across OCR/LLM/Sheets/Slack
- Harden error handling and retries in the Slack runner
- Consider HTTP mode implementation for alternative deployment scenarios 

## Status Update â€“ Vision/PDF flow
- Image receipts: extracted via vision chat; transcripts logged; structuring via Granite with stricter prompt and retry
- PDFs: extracted via `pdfplumber` (no vision)
- Post-processing: vendor/amount/date/location/description heuristics; duplicate detection intact
- Known issue: intermittent Granite invalid JSON responses on some receipts; temporary heuristic fallback implemented

## Action Items
- Investigate Granite function-style JSON or stronger constrained output
- Enhance receipt_number extraction and description summarization
- Complete Query Analyzer prompt and integration for NL queries over Google Sheets 

## Query Analyzer
- Implemented natural-language query analysis producing a JSON plan schema.
- Added robust prompt with schema and examples.
- Implemented `tools/query_analyzer.py` with parsing, defaults, and relative date resolution.
- Extended `tools/controller.py` to execute plans: filters (including text_search), grouping, trend bucketing, top-N, compare baseline vs target, sorting, and output rendering (summary/table/chart text).
- Tests updated/added in `tests/test_integrations/test_query_flow.py`.

Next steps
- Consider adding vendor/category normalization tables for better matching.
- Expand trend sorting for strict chronological order across granularities.
- Optional: expose CSV export for table results.
