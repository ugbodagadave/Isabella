# Active Context

Current Focus:
- M2 Integrations: expand Granite client interface; extend Google Sheets and Slack clients; keep tests mocked

Next Steps:
- Maintain mocks for external services; no live network calls in tests
- Proceed to end-to-end flow refinements in M3 after M2 solidifies

Decisions:
- Keep `GraniteClient.generate` unimplemented locally; rely on mocks
- Extend integrations with helper methods to simplify orchestration
