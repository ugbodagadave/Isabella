# Active Context

Current Focus:
- M5 Deployment: Local IBM watsonx Orchestrate Developer Edition with Socket Mode Slack integration; production-like flow verified end-to-end

Recent Changes:
- ✅ Local Orchestrate Developer Edition started via Docker
- ✅ Agent imported with `spec_version: v1` and Granite model set: `ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct`
- ✅ Slack Socket Mode listener implemented at `tools/slack_socket_runner.py`
- ✅ `tools/slack_interface.py` downloads Slack files and forwards `local_path` to controller
- ✅ End-to-end receipt flow validated from Slack upload → OCR → Granite JSON → schema validation → Google Sheets append → Slack confirmation

Operational Notes:
- Socket Mode used (no ngrok required). If HTTP mode is preferred, use ngrok and configure `/slack/events` and `/slack/actions` URLs.
- Logs: use `orchestrate server logs` for platform services and run the socket listener to observe Slack events.

Next Steps:
- Add interactive manual review (Approve/Reject) buttons for low confidence/duplicates
- Expand observability: correlation IDs and duration metrics across OCR/LLM/Sheets/Slack
- Harden error handling and retries in the Slack runner
