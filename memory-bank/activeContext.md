# Active Context

Current Focus:
- Scaffold created: folders, configs, docs, schemas, stubs, tests
- Planning docs: `isabella-plan.md`, `isabella-guide.md`

Next Steps:
- Install dependencies (ADK deferred) and run tests locally
- Implement Granite client actual calls
- Google credentials present under `./config/`
- Confirm environment variable semantics marked NEED-CONFIRM in `isabella-plan.md`

Decisions:
- Use JSON schemas for validation
- Keep Slack handler minimal and controller-driven
