# Progress

- M0/M1 completed with solid tools, schema validation, preprocessing, logging, and tests.
- M2 completed: expanded `GraniteClient` with `build_request`, extended `SlackApi` with file upload, extended `GoogleSheetsClient` with create/open helpers; tests added and passing.
- M3 started: added `tools/controller.py` orchestrating OCR → Granite → schema validation → Sheets append with duplicate detection; tests added and passing.
- All tests pass locally with pytest.
- Next: move toward M4 query flow (LLM-based query understanding → Sheets data retrieval).
