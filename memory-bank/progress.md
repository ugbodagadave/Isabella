# Progress

- M0/M1 completed with solid tools, schema validation, preprocessing, logging, and tests.
- M2 completed: expanded `GraniteClient` with `build_request`, extended `SlackApi` with file upload, extended `GoogleSheetsClient` with create/open helpers; tests added and passing.
- M3 finalized: added `tools/controller.py` with retries, duplicate detection, and extended Sheets mapping (Processed_Date, Confidence_Score); tests added and passing.
- All tests pass locally with pytest.
- Next: move toward M4 query flow (LLM-based query understanding â†’ Sheets data retrieval).
