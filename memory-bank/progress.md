# Progress

- Created scaffolding, plan, guide, config, schemas, stubs, docs, and tests.
- Implemented M1 improvements: schema validation in `ReceiptProcessor`, preprocessing and robust error handling in `TextExtractor`, logging in tools, expanded unit tests (OCR image/PDF paths, schema pass/fail, Slack handler invocation).
- All tests pass locally with pytest.
- ADK remains deferred to deployment phase.
- Next: refine prompts if needed and proceed to M2 integrations with mocks/clients.
