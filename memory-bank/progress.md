# Progress

- M0/M1 completed with solid tools, schema validation, preprocessing, logging, and tests.
- Added integration-like tests for Google Sheets client, Slack API, and an end-to-end mocked receipt flow.
- M2 updates: expanded `GraniteClient` with `build_request`, extended `SlackApi` with file upload, extended `GoogleSheetsClient` with create/open helpers.
- All tests pass locally with pytest.
- Next: move toward M3 end-to-end orchestration refinements using existing mocks.
